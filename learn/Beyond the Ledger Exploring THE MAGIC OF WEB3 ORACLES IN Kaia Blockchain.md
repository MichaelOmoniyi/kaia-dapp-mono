# Beyond the Ledger: Exploring the Magic of Web3 Oracles in Kaia Blockchain

The digital messengers that enable smart contracts to access real-world data, opening up new possibilities for decentralized applications are Oracles. Oracles play a crucial role as intermediaries between the deterministic blockchain and the dynamic external world, by bridging the gap between on-chain and off-chain information. Oracles empower blockchains to react to current events, not just predetermined rules. From cryptocurrency prices to weather updates, oracles bring the real world into the blockchain ecosystem.

In this article, we will explore how oracles function, their types (pull-based and push-based), and how they integrate with the Kaia blockchain. We will examine practical examples of fetching real-time data and generating random numbers, showcasing the potential of these innovative tools in shaping the future of decentralized applications.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of blockchain technology and smart contracts
- Understanding of the concept of oracles in blockchain systems
- Familiarity with Solidity programming language
- Access to a Kaia Chain development environment
- Installation of Foundry, a tool for Ethereum development
- Git and basic command line skills
- Knowledge of web3.js or ethers.js libraries for interacting with blockchains
- Understanding of decentralized finance (DeFi) concepts
- Familiarity with the Kaia Chain architecture and tools
- Basic knowledge of cryptocurrency markets and price feeds.

## What is Oracle?

An oracle is any element, gadget, or system that interfaces a deterministic blockchain network with offline, external information. This link enables smart contracts to access, verify, and utilize real-world data, bridging the gap between the on-chain economy and the real world.

### Definition breakdown of Oracle:
- **Deterministic blockchain networks:** Blockchain platforms like Ethereum and Bitcoin operate deterministically, which means the same input always produces the same outputs. This ensures consistency and predictability across the network.
- **Offline information:** Data sources outside the blockchain ecosystem, such as sports results, election outcomes, IoT sensor readings, weather APIs, and stock prices.
- **Interfacing:** Oracles act as communication layers, translating external data into a format compatible with blockchain-based smart contracts.
- **Element, gadget, or system:** Oracles can take various forms, including software APIs, hardware devices, or human-operated services.

### Oracle services employ two approaches.

1. **Pull-based Oracles:** It involves smart contracts actively requesting or retrieving data from the database consistently. The Oracle node listens for these requests and fetches the required data on demand.

#### How It Works:
- A smart contract initiates a data request
- The Oracle node detects this request
- The node queries the specified external data source
- Data is processed and validated
- The oracle returns the data to the smart contract

#### Example:

```solidity
contract PullBasedExample {
    address public oracle;
    uint256 public ethereumPrice;    
  
  function requestEthereumPrice() external {
        // Request price update from Oracle
        OracleInterface(oracle).requestData("ETH/USD");
    }
        function fulfillRequest(uint256 price) external {
        require(msg.sender == oracle, "Only oracle can fulfill");
        ethereumPrice = price;
    }
}
```

2. **Push-based Oracles:** Automatically send data to smart contracts when certain conditions are met, instead of waiting for the smart contract to ask for it.

#### How It Works:
- Oracle nodes continuously monitor data sources
- When specific conditions are met the oracle automatically pushes data to relevant smart contracts
- Smart contracts process the received data.

#### Example:

```solidity
contract PushBasedExample {
    address public oracle;
    uint256 public ethereumPrice;
    
    function updatePrice(uint256 newPrice) external {
        require(msg.sender == oracle, "Only oracle can update");
        ethereumPrice = newPrice;
    }
}
```

### Differences between Pull-based and Push-based Oracles
1. Pull oracles support a wide selection of price feeds, while push oracles have a more limited selection.
2. Push oracle price feed updates at a fixed frequency, typically between every 10 minutes to 1 hour, whereas pull oracles can update at a much higher frequency.
3. Pull-based Oracle requires a contract to initiate the request, while Push-based Oracle initiates the data transfer.
4. Pull oracles support more blockchains, whereas Push oracles typically support fewer due to gas costs.

### Oracle Providers
#### Pull-Based Providers:
- Chainlink (supports both pull and push)
- Band Protocol
- API3
- Tellor
- UMA Protocol
- Pyth Network

#### Push-Based Providers:
- Chainlink (Keepers and Data Feeds)
- Razor Network
- Witnet
- DIA

## Integration of Oracles with the Kaia blockchain

We have highlighted a list of Oracle services supporting Kaia in both categories.

### Pyth Price Feed

Pyth Network is an Oracle protocol that connects the owners of market data to applications on multiple blockchains. Each price feed publishes a robust aggregate of these prices multiple times per second.

#### Integrating Pyth with your smart contract on the Kaia chain:

- Address of the Kaia chain: `0x2880ab155794e7179c9ee2e38200202908c17b43`
- Pyth price feed id of the Kaia chain: `0x2880ab155794e7179c9ee2e38200202908c17b43`

#### Code Example: Pyth PriceFeed Integration

Check the `PriceConverterPyth.sol` file for how to integrate and generate KLAY/USD price on the Pyth network.

### Orakl VRF Integration

This section demonstrates how to fetch and utilize off-chain data using Orakl, a decentralized Oracle solution.

#### Code Example: Orakl VRF Integration

Check the `CoinFlip.sol` file for how to generate random numbers on the Orakl network. 

## Conclusion:

Integrating Oracle services into the Kaia blockchain ecosystem marks an important advancement in connecting on-chain and off-chain data. Pull-based and push-based oracles, exemplified by Pyth Network and Orakl, offer developers flexible, wide options to optimize data freshness, cost efficiency, and update frequency.

Kaia's ecosystem, with its diverse oracle providers, demonstrates Kaia's maturity and potential for innovation in decentralized applications.
